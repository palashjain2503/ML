# ML
used basic statistical ml models to classify spam vs ham messages(SVM,KNN).
built a sentiment analysis model using LSTM for memory that classifies reviews as positve or negative sentiment.
used CNN to detect tumors from MRI scans of brain.

built a basic RAG model where I stored the laws of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) in a vector Database. Then from user query I retrieved data from that database using semantic search and passed it to an LLM model to generate a response.
